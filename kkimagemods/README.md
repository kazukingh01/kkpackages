## Making And Activating Your Virtual Environment
Instead of installing this package to your system's environment, we recommend that you install everything to a virtual environment.

```shell
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Package Installation
**TODO: Put things in the [package folder](package_template).**

From the root directory of this repository, you can install the "package_template" package with the following command.

```shell
pip install -e .
#For MacOS Development
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ pip install -e .
```

The "package_template" package, together with all dependencies, should be installed to your virtual environment.

## Usage
TODO

## Test Scripts
All test scripts should be managed in the [test folder](test).

Note that the test folder is not included when the package is built.
